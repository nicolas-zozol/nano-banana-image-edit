- image[0] shows a black woman with an orange dress

Deliver a single image that contains only the orange dress arranged naturally, as if displayed on an invisible mannequin. Maintain the original silhouette, neckline, sleeve length, hem shape, and decorative elements. Ensure clean edges, realistic shading, and no leftover fragments from the person or background.
