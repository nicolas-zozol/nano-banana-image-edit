Use the dress from the previous images and put it on the woman in the last image.

Match the exact cut, neckline, sleeve length, hem, color, pattern, and fabric texture of the reference dress.

Fit & physics: conform naturally to her pose and body without altering anatomy; maintain realistic cloth drape and tension.

Lighting: re-shade the dress to match the target scene’s light and shadows; add correct contact shadows at waist, arms, and neckline.

Edges & cleanup: produce clean garment edges; remove remnants of the original outfit; avoid spill into skin or background.

Keep unchanged: face, hair, body shape, jewelry, hands, and background. Maintain the original crop.
