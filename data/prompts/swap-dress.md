Reference (image[0]): black woman wearing an orange dress.
Target (image[1]): asian woman wearing a black dress.
Task: Replace the target’s current outfit with the orange dress from image[0], completely removing the black dress.

Match: exact cut, neckline, sleeve length, hem, orange color, pattern (if any), and fabric texture of the reference dress.
Fit & physics: conform to the target’s current pose without altering anatomy; maintain realistic fabric drape and tension.
Lighting: re-shade the new dress to match the target scene’s light and shadows; add correct contact shadows at waist, arms, and neckline.
Edges & cleanup: produce clean garment edges; remove all remnants of the original outfit; no color spill into skin or background.
Keep unchanged: face, hair, body shape, jewelry, hands, and background. Maintain the original crop.
Occlusions: if parts of the dress are hidden by arms or hair, complete them minimally and plausibly.
