Reference (image[0]): black woman wearing an orange dress.
Target (image[1]): blonde woman in the street wearing a white dress.
Task: Overwrite the target’s garment by erasing the white dress and applying the orange dress from image[0] onto the target.

Match — exact cut, neckline, sleeve length, hem, reference orange color, and fabric texture of the reference dress.
Fit & physics — conform naturally to the target’s current pose without altering anatomy; realistic drape and tension.
Lighting — re-shade the new dress to match the target scene’s light/shadows; add consistent contact shadows at waist, arms, and neckline.
Edges & cleanup — produce clean garment edges; remove all remnants of the original outfit/patterns; no color spill into skin/background.
Keep unchanged — face, hair, body shape, jewelry, hands, and background. Maintain the original crop.
Occlusions — if parts of the dress are hidden by arms/hair, complete them minimally and plausibly.
