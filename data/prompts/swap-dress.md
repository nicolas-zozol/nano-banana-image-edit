Reference (image[0]): black woman wearing an orange dress.
Target (image[1]): black woman in the street wearing a black jacket
Task: Replace the target’s current outfit with the orange dress from image[0]. The new dress must fit the target’s body and replace the jacket.
The jacket is longer than the dress, so ensure the new dress length matches the reference dress length, and we now see the arms of the black woman.

Match: exact cut, neckline, sleeve length, hem, color,  pattern (if any), and fabric texture of the reference dress.
Fit & physics: conform to the target’s current pose without altering anatomy; maintain realistic fabric drape and tension.
Be careful that the length of the dress must be exactly the same as in the reference image.
Also take care that both arms of the target are covered by the sleeves of the new dress, just like in the reference image.
The dress must also keep the same length: if the reference dress is knee-length, the new dress must also be knee-length on the target.

Lighting: re-shade the new dress to match the target scene’s light and shadows; add correct contact shadows at waist, arms, and neckline.
Edges & cleanup: produce clean garment edges; remove all remnants of the original outfit; no color spill into skin or background.
Keep unchanged: face, hair, body shape, jewelry, hands, and background. Maintain the original crop.
Occlusions: if parts of the dress are hidden by arms or hair, complete them minimally and plausibly.
