Reference (image[0]): black woman wearing an orange dress.
Target (image[1]): asian woman wearing a black dress.
Task: Replace the target’s current outfit with the orange dress from image[0], completely removing the black dress.

Match: exact cut, neckline, sleeve length, hem, orange color, pattern (if any), and fabric texture of the reference dress.
Fit & physics: conform to the target’s current pose without altering anatomy; maintain realistic fabric drape and tension.
Be careful that the length of the dress must be exactly the same as in the reference image.
Also take care that both arms of the target are covered by the sleeves of the new dress, just like in the reference image.

Lighting: re-shade the new dress to match the target scene’s light and shadows; add correct contact shadows at waist, arms, and neckline.
Edges & cleanup: produce clean garment edges; remove all remnants of the original outfit; no color spill into skin or background.
Keep unchanged: face, hair, body shape, jewelry, hands, and background. Maintain the original crop.
Occlusions: if parts of the dress are hidden by arms or hair, complete them minimally and plausibly.
