Reference (image[0]): black woman wearing a black and white jumpsuit.
Other angle of reference (image[1]): same woman, same black and white jumpsuit, with another angle and zoomed in darker light.
Target (image[2]): asian woman in the supermarket pushing a caddie wearing a black dress.
Task: Overwrite the target’s garment by erasing the black dress and applying the full black and white jumpsuit from image[0] onto the target.

Match — exact cut, neckline, sleeve length, hem, reference orange color, and fabric texture of the reference jumpsuit.
Fit & physics — conform naturally to the target’s current pose without altering anatomy; realistic drape and tension.
Lighting — re-shade the new jumpsuit to match the target scene’s light/shadows; add consistent contact shadows at waist, arms, and neckline.
Edges & cleanup — produce clean garment edges; remove all remnants of the original outfit/patterns; no color spill into skin/background.
Keep unchanged — face, hair, body shape, jewelry, hands, and background. Maintain the original crop.
Occlusions — if parts of the jumpsuit are hidden by arms/hair, complete them minimally and plausibly.
